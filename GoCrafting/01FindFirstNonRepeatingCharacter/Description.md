# Go Code Challenge: Find the First Non-Repeating Character

## Problem Description

Write a Go function that takes a string as input and returns the first non-repeating character in the string.

### Input

A string s (1 <= len(s) <= 10^5) where s consists of printable ASCII characters.

### Output

Return the first non-repeating character as a byte. If there are no non-repeating characters, return 0 (null byte).

### Examples

- **01**
input: "leetcode"
output: 'l'

- **02**
input: "loveleetcode"
output: 'v'

- **03**
input: "aabbcc"
output: 0 // No non-repeating characters

### Notes

- You should find the first character in the string that appears only once and return it.
- You can assume that the input string will always contain at least one character.

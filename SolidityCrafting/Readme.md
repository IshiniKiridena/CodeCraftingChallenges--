## About Solidity

Solidity is a high-level programming language used for writing smart contracts on the Ethereum platform. It's essential for creating decentralized applications (DApps) and blockchain-based solutions.

**Note:** All Solidity contracts in this folder are tested on Remix, an online Solidity IDE and compiler. You can easily test and deploy your contracts using Remix.
